Description
--------------------------------------------------
Recipal allows you to create, share, rate, search and store recipes locally on your device.  
Storing the recipes locally allows access to your recipes even with out being connected 
to the Internet.  

You can share recipes by Bumping your devices together via the integrated Bump Api.
Recipes are currently searchable by the name of the recipe. If you ever are at a lost
for what to cook, when viewing all your recipes you can shake the device and it 
will randomly choose a recipe for you.
